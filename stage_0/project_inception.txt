Idea 1:
Integrating database to last years website Ante Mortem.
Added functionality could include a login service which could store and optionally display users' information. Once logged in users could comment on comic pages, as well as perhaps use a forum for other discussion.
It would also enable the comic pages to be displayed individually on each page, without specifically recreating each page's html every time a new image needs uploading.


Idea 2:
Warehouse tracking system for items stored.
This would track gin, whisky and beer from production to sale. Would be possible to input liters of liquid into system, output bottles as sales.
Information stored would cover number of bottles, batch number, spirit type, bottle size, ABV, labelled Y/N, duty stamp range, duty paid/suspended.
The front end would be written as a application rather than website, and allow users to keep track of stock.
